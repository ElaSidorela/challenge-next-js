To open our Next.js project, navigate to the project folder in your terminal, and then run the following commands:
cd
npm install
npm run dev (start)

 before seen  the app, please: as weâ€™re using json-server, open a new terminal window, navigate to your API directory, and start the server:
npm run server.
